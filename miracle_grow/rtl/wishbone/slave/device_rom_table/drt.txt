Device Rom Table (DRT)

A wishbone slave that maps all the devices in the interconnect.

-This slave should be located at address 0 on the wishbone interconnect
-The controlling software should query this ROM in order to determine the devices and where they are located on the wishbone bus
-Initially designed for 32 bit words

Organization of the ROM 32 bit address location

0x00							DRT_ID (DRT ID), DRT_VERSION (version number)
	(Addr: 31-16)	: Version WW.XX.YY.ZZ
	(Addr: 15-0)	: DRT_ID (1EAF)
0x01							DRT_NUM_DEVICES (Number of devices attached)
0x02							RFU
0x03							RFU

0x04:DEV_OFFSET	beginning of device offset (DRT_DEV_OFFSET)

DRT_DEV_OFFSET[x * 4] + 0:		Device ID (flag to indicate this is a standard device or not)
	(Addr: 31-0	)	: device ID number (see below)
DRT_DEV_OFFSET[x * 4] + 1:		FLAGS
	(Addr: 0 )		: standard device (can use generic drivers)
DRT_DEV_OFFSET[x * 4] + 2:		Offset from 0x00 	(NEED A NAME)
DRT_DEV_OFFSET[x * 4] + 3:		Size of address space for device (NEED A NAME)



THIS IS NOT BY ANY MEANS FINAL, BUT MAKING DEVICE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
0000	: Nothing
0001	: GPIO
0002	: UART
