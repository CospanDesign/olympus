-Everthing that is initiates an action from another core (input to that core) is _en
-Everthing that is an output of a core to indicate that it is ready (output from that core) is _ready

interconnect:
	-these are the structures that facilitate the communication between an entity outside of the FPGA and the wishbone master.
	-there are three planned: UART, FSMC (parallel memory interface for OAK), PCIE
	-the structures have a defined interface that must be followed because the sap library that generates the project will be looking for specific inputs and outputs

	-all io handlers must have

	clk: clock
	rst: reset

	ih_ready: (output 1 bit)new data from the input handler is available

	in_command: (output 32 bit) command word that was read from the outside entity
	in_address: (output 32 bit) address word that was read from the outside entity
	in_data: (output 32 bit) data word that was read from the outside entity
	in_data_count: (output 28 bits) the number of data words the will be 
		followed (usually accompanied by a "stream read" command

	oh_ready: (output 1 bit) the output handler is ready to read data from 
		the master
	oh_en: (input 1 bit) output handler is ready to write data to the outside 
		entity

	out_status: (input 32 bits) status word that the master will send to the
		outside entity
	out_address: (input 32 bits) address word the master sends to the outside 
		enity
	out_data: (input 32 bits) data word the master sends to the outside entity
	out_data_count: (input 28 bit) the number of data words that will follow the 
		initial data work

	PHY SIGNALS
	**any phy signals that are required by the handler
